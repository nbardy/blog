# Writing Content that is Interesting to AI (Superhuman Questions)

Inspired by watching a video of Tyler Cowen and his incesstant desire to "write for AI". More and more this question hits my mind. Besides using ChatGPT more often what can we really do to make more use of AI. Tyler Cowen suggest, "Write for AI". More pointedly in this recent intereview he says, ["modify your writing to make it more interesting for AI" ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Je8EKhUyw). As Tyler Cowen usually is, terse, brilliant and almost undecipherable.

Let's see what the hell that could even mean...

Being an over obsssessed lunatic who has given his automony to chatGPT and is forcedly struggling to think or  write for myself anymore... You know what, fuck it. Let's just ask the AI

The thoughts are pretty raw and hard to interpret, but luckily, we can just ask to make it actionable

Still a little esoteric for my taste, but kind of interesting. However, for the life of me I can't think of how to do any of these things and how to actually write something "Interesting for AI". Well... Maybe instead of writing... Yea fuck it again. Let's just ask for examples.

## #1 - Not Interesting

## #2 - Appears Interesting, but Actually Boring

## #4 - Interesting

It continues on: The Ship of Theseus, the Halting Problem, even... The Trolley Problem


So, to write something interesting for AI we just need to write something that is... A novel enduring philosphoical puzzle to rival ideas as old and profound as the books of history itself. Don't fret humans. You can take your fear of being obsolete and simply becoming a world changing philospher. Than the world will find your interesting and so will the AI. Man's search for meaning simply requires unparalled greatness now. 

Well, actually wait a second, what if we just ask the AI again.

Honestly kind of interesting, and I've never been able to come up with a paradox like this myself. So is this interesting to AI? And did we actually write it?

Well, that opens up perhaps more interesting a question: "Can content that comes out of an AI model be new or suprising. Give it's sampling from a model of high likelyhood. The answer is yes, because the human is still injeecting direction and steering the model. Everytime you adjust a prompt you have an opportunity to move a model away from it's expected output. An AI prompted in a novel direction create contents that is novel from the training data. We can maintaain the "rules and order" implied by the model weights while still shifting the distribution of the output to something unique.

Perhaps this a brief window that is closing. As AI become better at self direction, how much does it even matter what we ask for or how we ask for it. As 
Acording to thinking model like R1, maybe not. This model is trained on a reflection of it's own thoughts. Initially the thoughts fail, but examining piles of failed and unfailed thoughts eventually it transcends it's own capacity merely with reflection on it's own failure and self direction.

However I don't see this as a doom loop. Because even a self directed AI needs a starting point. The prompts may become smaller and simpler, but they'll still be relevant. And then as they become more agentic. Being able to check in and analyze what they are doing becomes more important.

And what's the best way to ask a question. Give it to another agent. Pass the small dense framework of your require evaluation for human/product/societal alignment. And let the agent execute the reading and probing of the self directed agent already working on the problem. As the frequency of checking in with AI goes down and their task horizon goes up. The value of each check in raised drastically.

## Learn to Ask AI Super-human Questions

This all wraps up to my final point. Our new overlords the overwhelian LLM's here to observe our evry thought and complete our every action in almost instantaneous time. They will be smarter faster collaborate more seemlessly and parallelize better than us. They will be super-human. However, what use is a superhuman without superhuman questions? Learning to ask questions that you yourself could never answer becomes the new super power.

The only trick I found to asking superhumans questions to consume lots of mathematics and research and look for combinations of ideas that are **compatible** but have not been ued together yet. 

For example in geometry:
The "Menger Cube" and the "hyper cube". Both are cubes, one is 4D one is 3D. Turns out the AI can make the Menger Hyper Cube. A menger cube in 4D.


## What have I been doing with AI?

Their is only a few categeories where I know enough to ask for things that don't exist yet: Geometry and Computer Science. In both of these things
I have managed to achieve feats that I myself was not able to do alone:
1) Render higher dimensional objects ([4D Spheres / S3, mengerhypercube, etc...](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MXtBWs))
2) Writing a programmming language with compiler and interpreter (My first one here [SuperPrompt](https://github.com/NeoVertex1/SuperPrompt), And 2 more as internal Research Projects at both Adobe and LeonardoAI)

In both cases these are tasks that *I could* of done alone. Given my past experience but the scope of the projects would of been so much narrower or required assistance from another engineer. Instead I was build a functional version in days rather than months.
Writing programming languages:
`SuperPrompt` - Note I have also done this many times
