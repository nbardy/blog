## How to use AI

## First Steps
Buy good models!
ChatGPT or Claude. Get a plus account at least $20-40 (These are about equivalent)
(But also o1-pro is worth it, YOLO coding is real)

It's worth $2k a year. I swear.


## Base Models vs RL
Base models

These moels are so fun. They happen to follow your instructions beecause they've seen lots of instructions.

RL models follow your instructons because they're compelling the unyielding reward force to get your thing done.
The force is effective, but narrow.
RL models are a high dimensional cone focused towards a single (Maybe right, solutio)

Base models are a spider web towards many solutions all in a log prob soup.


## Chain of Thought

Chain of Thought is everythig, you can do anything besides but thinkings in context.


## Reasoning and Thinking Models have

### Reasoning
Reasoning is...
Self prompt planning and self directed multi step solving
Reasoning emerges with enough good instruct data
(Let's think step by step)
RL, DPO and reward

Reasoning models generally do the chain of thought implicitly
Claude 3 + <think>  = prompts ~= Claude 3.5


### Thinking
Thinking is extened reasoning
you can think and think and think

[<think> 10x times] x10 
Claude 3 + <think> + ( Continue ...) ~= Claude 3.7 Thinking



Understand MUlti Turn and RL.

RL is inheritly 

Reasoning is inherantly unidirectional
Thining is inherently unidirectional

Unidirectional is anti - CoT
